Made my JS basics even stronger by learning template Literals. They turned oout to be prettty useful in case I wanted to use function in between strings.

Template literals saved me from bulky use of + and " instead I could use ${} also, they provided the ability to break the code into multiple lined. This resulted in a more understandable code and better Format.


Also, learnt differnce between
   .textContent and .innerHTML
